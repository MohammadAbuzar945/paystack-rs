# Paystack-rs

A rust crate that wraps around the paystack REST API. [WIP]. Not ready for use yet.

## Whats working and whats yet to be done?

Currently, there are methods for every transactions endpoint. Anything apart from that is not ready yet. I recently started working on it and since I have a full-time job that takes my time, I basically just try to write like a few minutes or an hour a day of open-source code and this is one. Therefore, I still have a lot of things to do.

Some things to be done (Endpoints) are:

- [x] Transactions
- [ ] Transactions splits
- [ ] Customers
- [ ] Dedicated NUBAN
- [ ] Subaccounts
- [ ] Plans
- [ ] Subscription
- [ ] Products
- [ ] Payment pages
- [ ] Invoices
- [ ] Settlement
- [ ] Transfer recipients
- [ ] Transfers
- [ ] Transfers Control
- [ ] Bulk Charges
- [ ] Control Panel
- [ ] Charge
- [ ] Dispute
- [ ] Refunds
- [ ] Verifications
- [ ] Miscellaneous

Other things are:

- [ ] Tests (i know!! tests are important! ðŸ™ƒ)
- [ ] Support reading Bearer access token and similar sensitive information from .env file
- [ ] Proper comments and documentation

## How to use

```rust
use paystack_rs::prelude::{InitializeTransactionBody, Paystack};
use reqwest::Error;
use serde::Deserialize;
use std::result::Result;

fn main() {
    testing_stuff()
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct InitializeTxResponse {
    status: bool,
    message: String,
    data: Data,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct Data {
    authorization_url: String,
    access_code: String,
}
fn testing_stuff() {
    // replace with a valid test keys
    let paystack = Paystack::new("mmdmfkdfm".to_string());
    let body = InitializeTransactionBody {
        amount: 10,
        email: "oayomide@enyata.com".to_string(),
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let response: Result<InitializeTxResponse, Error> = paystack
        .transaction
        .initialize_transaction(body)
        .unwrap()
        .json();
    println!("Result: {:?}", response.unwrap());
    // InitializeTxResponse { status: true, message: "Authorization URL created", data: Data { authorization_url: "https://checkout.paystack.com/gx9mi6ihvnw5s9s", access_code: "gx9mi6ihvnw5s9s" } }
}
```

The above is taken from the `bin.rs` file. It imports the crate, takes the access token and returns an "instance" of paystack. It then creates the transactions body that the `initialize_transaction()` method (for Paystack's Initialize Transaction endpoint) takes. it then then calls the method as needed. Quite obvious and straightforward.
